# Dodge-Sphere <br>
I've created a simplified version of the Dodge Sphere game that should work more reliably. <br>
Here are the improvements I made: <br>
**1. Distinct Design**<br>
-Made the player sphere larger (25px radius)<br>
-Used bright cyan as the base color<br>
-Added a white inner circle<br>
-Added "YOU" text in the center<br>
-Added a pulsing magenta glow effect around the sphere<br>
**2. Movement Indicator**<br>
-Added a yellow directional arrow that shows which way you're moving<br>
-The arrow appears whenever you press movement keys<br>
-This helps you quickly identify both your sphere and its movement direction<br>
**3. Visual Differentiation**<br>
-The player sphere now has multiple colors and layers, making it stand out from the obstacles<br>
-The pulsing effect draws attention to your character even when stationary<br>
**4. Control Instructions**<br>
-Added text at the bottom showing the controls<br>
**5. To play the game**<br>
-Use arrow keys or WASD to move your blue sphere<br>
-Avoid the colorful obstacles coming at you from all directions<br>
-Your score increases the longer you survive<br>
-When you hit an obstacle, the game ends and you can restart<br>
